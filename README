========================================================

the point?

no real point. I read this http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2011/03/28/storager-case-study-bing-google/

and I figured it may be a fun little excercise to try out!


========================================================


CAVEATS:
completely untested at the moment.

needs localStorage support - so old it no work on older browsers.

will only work with local resources, i.e. urls on your domain
that means hotlinking stuff will no work.
(you know, I can prolly try something else to access non-local resources, but I'm lazy..
.. and it's a version 0 thing. /trollface)


primarily aimed for iphone safari and android browsers.




========================================================

HOW TO USE:

	1) replace your local script tags from:
		<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/file/javascript.js"></script> 
		
		to
		
	    <meta name="localstorage:javascript" content="/path/to/file/javascript.js#version0" />
		
	2) replace your local css link tags from:
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/file/stylesheet.css">
		
		to
		
		<meta name="localStorage:stylesheet" content="/path/to/file/stylesheet.css#version0" />

	3) add the bootloader somewhere near the bottom of your page.
	
and that's pretty much it. Now you iphone safari will use localStorage to cache your js files

========================================================
ok so this is how it works:

1) add a the localStorage loader script somewhere near the bottom of your html
2) the script searches for tags like this (in your header):

    <meta name="localstorage:javascript" content="/path/to/file/javascript.js#version0" />
    <meta name="localStorage:stylesheet" content="/path/to/file/stylesheet.css#version0" />


Upon finding these tags, it'll simply do a quickie lookup in localStorage and see if
	1) it doesn't exist or
	2) if it's out of date
	
If any of those apply, the script downloads them via the intarwebs, and loads it in your page,
 and it also keeps a copy in your localStorage container

If neither of those apply, the script says, "STOP ALL THE DOWNLOADIN!" and grabs the copy
of the contents in the localStorage container.


========================================================

"why use fragments for versioning?"

I honestly don't know. I didn't think using queries was a good idea.
I also thought about using a completely custom tag like 

<localscript version="" src="">

there version would be a custom attr that I can check against.
And I figured that may be easier for html coders to decipher, but I dunno.

In the end, I figured fragments themselves are the least volatile part of a uri.

========================================================

"does this even work"

well, yeah I guess. The only browsers I've tested it on so far was

	FF4
	Safari 5.0.5
	Chrome
	That version of Safari on the iphone.
	
I haven't tried it out on android yet but I will.

Prolly not gonna work on that crappy blackberry storm, especially moreso when javascript is disabled.
